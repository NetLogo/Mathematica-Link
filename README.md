# NetLogo-Mathematica Link

This package allows Mathematica to control NetLogo (and not vice versa)

## Using

The Mathematica Link comes with NetLogo.  For more information, see the NetLogo User Manual.

## Building

A Makefile is provided.  You'll need to have a copy of NLink.jar from the Mathematica installation in order to build. If compilation succeeds, `NLink.class` and several other `.class` files will be created.

## Credits

The primary developer of the NetLogo-Mathematica link was Eytan Bakshy.
